## Box Game Revamped

The long overdue of recreating my first ever game using a library from so long
ago is finally here.

### Context:

When I was at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), the Barrett
Honors program required honors projects for courses of our choosing. I wanted to
challenge myself as a first semester coder to come up with a game with the basic
python knowledge I had.

Using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), I came up with a box game with
basic arrow key movement to cover randomly appearing boxes in a window. I
designed the game to have a set number of moves, and the player's job was to
cover as many boxes as possible.
